Feedback assignment 2:

Test results:

2_check_write_through should have 3 read hits for Cache 0. Does it invalidate itself here?
Stat issues for testcase 3.
Delay modeling issues for testcase 4. Should take ~500 cycles.
Expect only one cache to have the line in valid state after the four write race.
9 write misses should take 1800 cycles in the VI model.
A lot of delay and hitrate issues.
Report:

Component overview is very short. Some more (implementation) details could be useful.
The snooping method is not the V-I coherency protocol. Data forwarding is something you will do in the MOESI assignment.
The hitrate trend is unexpected. Test your model with the unit tests/edge cases.
Speedup results could be interesting.
Missing deeper analysis of the experiment results.


- Cheat by bypassing of the bus.
- Unneeded locking.
- Zero time actions.
- delay issues

- Snooping threads cannot miss messages due to blocking or other reasons.
- Flags set incorrectly or not cleared.
- Wrong/no addresses used in messages.
- Wrong assumptions about the assignment.
- Implicit modeling of pipeline memory that is overly optimistic.




QUESTIONS
When a resource is to become shared, only the requesting cache does so?
