READ
	P1 requests data at 0000
	
	C1 miss read 
		- send bus mem request from memory
		- waits 100ns for the result
		- evicts if anything to evict
		- sends data to CPU
	
	C1 hit read 
		- check for validity 
		- if invalid retrieve memory 
		- set to valid 
		- send to CPU

WRITE
	P1 writes data at 0000
	
	C1 miss write 
		- send bus mem request from memory
		- waits 100ns for the result
		- evicts if anything to evict
		- sends data to CPU
		- broadcasts invalidation bit to the bus 

	
	C1 hit write 
		- update value 
		- broadcast invalidation to the bus for 0000
		- write-through to memory (wait to complete)
		- 
		

Snooping protocol
State transitions
	Stay invalid 
		- recv NR, NW, PW (issue NW)
	Stay valid
		- recv PR, NR, PW (issue NW)
	Go  invalid
