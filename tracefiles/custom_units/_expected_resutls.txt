Basic MOESI cache state transition test:

P0: INVALID -> EXCLUSIVE -> SHARED -> MODIFIED -> OWNED
P1: INVALID -> SHARED -> INVALID -> SHARED
Read-only data sharing test:

All processors: INVALID -> SHARED, all lines stay SHARED after repeated reads
Exclusivity and invalidation test:

P0: INVALID -> EXCLUSIVE -> INVALID -> SHARED -> INVALID
P1: INVALID -> MODIFIED -> OWNED -> MODIFIED
Multiple writers test:

P0 and P1 race for MODIFIED, one wins and the other is invalidated
P2 and P3: INVALID -> SHARED, loading from the winner of the P0/P1 race
All processors write again, racing for MODIFIED
Eviction and re-requesting test:

P0: INVALID -> EXCLUSIVE -> SHARED -> INVALID (eviction) -> SHARED
P1: INVALID -> SHARED -> MODIFIED -> OWNED
Silent eviction and re-requesting test:

P0: INVALID -> MODIFIED -> INVALID (silent eviction) -> MODIFIED
P1: INVALID -> EXCLUSIVE -> INVALID
Owned state propagation test:

P0: INVALID -> MODIFIED -> OWNED -> INVALID
P1: INVALID -> SHARED -> MODIFIED
P2: INVALID -> SHARED -> INVALID
Owned to Shared transition test:

P0: INVALID -> MODIFIED -> OWNED -> SHARED, hit on final read
P1: INVALID -> SHARED, hit on final read
Exclusive to Modified transition test:

P0: INVALID -> EXCLUSIVE -> MODIFIED -> OWNED -> MODIFIED
P1: INVALID -> SHARED -> INVALID
